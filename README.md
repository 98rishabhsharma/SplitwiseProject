# SplitwiseProject
It do Debt-simplification in a group of people.  Debt-simplification is a feature of Splitwise that restructures debt within groups of people. It does not change the total amount that anyone owes, but it makes it easier to pay people back by minimizing the total number of payments.  For example  say Pooja,Chetan and Rishabh, share an apartment. Pooja owes Chetan Rs 2000, and Chetan owes Rishabh RS 2000. Rather than making two separate payments, Splitwise would tell Pooja to pay  Rs 2000 to Rishabh directly, thereby minimizing the total number of payments being made. This ensures that people are paid back more quickly and efficiently.
